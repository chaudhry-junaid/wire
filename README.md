Hola, and welcome!

Wire started life as a university project assignment for an aggressive
computer networks course. The project is intended to be a simulation of
different layers of a computer network stack including a simulation of the
physical layer that introduces random errors in the transmitted data to test
the integrity and performance of the network stack. It is a basic stack
intended to demonstrate computer network concepts and is by no means intended
as a production stack, nor is any comparison with TCP/IP or any other
production stack fair for this project.

This project was originally called NG-DS and was available in an earlier
non-working form at sourceforge. Over the course of various years the latest
revisions of the project were lost. Therefore, this current incarnation 
of the project starts with some incomplete code which I hope to complete
during the course of the next year or so. Although I mostly work in JavaScript
now, I would love to get this older project working and would also like if
someone posts any contributions to the project. I anticipate the project will
be helpful to students and hobbyists learning about networks and might be able
to provide useful code snippets and structure hints to them in making their
own basic network stack projects.

As of yet, the project is not working, I intend to make updates in the future.

Thanks!
