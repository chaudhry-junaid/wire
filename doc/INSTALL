Following are (as of yet) incomplete instructions on how to compile and install
the Wire for Linux/UNIX.

1. Compile using
	make depend
	make
2. Make sure the topology.txt file is to your liking

3. Bring the system up by running server first and then client multiple times
with relevant arguments (not described; see source):
	./server
	./client
5. Installing Wire
       make install
   Note: This is equivalent to the simple make instruction. Since this is only a system for demonstration, it is not installed to any system location, but only powered up from its current directory.
